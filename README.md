# BreastCancerAnalytics
BreastCancerAnalytics is a comprehensive data analysis tool designed to support research and decision-making processes related to breast cancer. 

Features
Data Import: BreastCancerAnalytics allows you to import breast cancer data from various sources, including CSV files.

Data Preprocessing: The tool provides a range of preprocessing techniques to clean and transform the imported data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: BreastCancerAnalytics enables you to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on breast cancer datasets. You can generate visualizations, calculate summary statistics, and identify patterns or relationships within the data.

Machine Learning Models: The tool offers a collection of machine learning algorithms specifically tailored for breast cancer analysis. You can train and evaluate models such as naive bayes, decision tree, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors.

Model Evaluation and Comparison: BreastCancerAnalytics provides evaluation metrics to assess the performance of your trained models. You can compare multiple models and select the most suitable one for your specific breast cancer analysis task.

Predictive Analytics: Using the trained models, you can make predictions on new breast cancer data. BreastCancerAnalytics simplifies the process of applying models to new observations and provides convenient output for further analysis.
